  abstract =	 {We present the O-ANTS theorem prover that is built on top of an
                  agent-based command suggestion mechanism. The theorem prover inherits
                  beneficial properties from the underlying suggestion mechanism such as
                  run-time extendibility and resource adaptability. Moreover, it supports
                  the distributed integration of external reasoning systems. We also
                  discuss how the implementation and modeling of a calculus in our
                  agent-based approach can be investigated wrt. the inheritance of
                  properties such as completeness and soundness.}
