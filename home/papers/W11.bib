  abstract =	 {This paper discusses experiments with an agent oriented approach to
                  automated and interactive reasoning. The approach combines ideas from
                  two subfields of AI (theorem proving/proof planning and multi-agent
                  systems) and makes use of state of the art distribution techniques to
                  decentralise and spread its reasoning agents over the internet. It
                  particularly supports cooperative proofs between reasoning systems which
                  are strong in different application areas, e.g., higher-order and
                  first-order theorem provers and computer algebra systems.}
