  abstract =	 {We investigate several approaches to resolution based automated theorem
                  proving in classical higher-order logic (based on Church's simply typed
                  lambda calculus) and discuss their requirements with respect to Henkin
                  completeness and full extensionality. In particular we focus on Andrews'
                  higher-order resolution [Andrews71], Huet's constrained resolution
                  [Huet72], higher-order $E$-resolution, and extensional higher-order
                  resolution [BenzmuellerKohlhase98]. With the help of examples we
                  illustrate the parallels and differences of the extensionality treatment
                  of these approaches and demonstrate that extensional higher-order
                  resolution is the sole approach that can completely avoid additional
                  extensionality axioms.},
