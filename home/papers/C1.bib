  abstract =	 {{Omega} is a mixed-initiative system with the ultimate purpose of
                  supporting theorem proving in main-stream mathematics and mathematics
                  education. The current system consists of a proof planner and an
                  integrated collection of tools for formulating problems, proving
                  subproblems, and proof presentation.}
