  abstract =	 {Verification of hybrid systems is a challenging task. Unlike many other
                  verification methods the approach proposed in [nonnengart99] avoids
                  approximations and operates directly on the original system
                  specifications. This approach, however, requires the solution of
                  non-trivial mathematical subtasks. We propose to model those kinds of
                  subtasks that are suitable for being tackled with reasoning specialists
                  as mathematical service requests to a network of service systems like
                  the MathWeb Software Bus. So far we have identified the following
                  candidates of mathematical service requests: the solution of
                  differential equations, subsumption and consistency of sets of
                  constraints. A further candidate can be the elimination of second order
                  set variables with higher order theorem provers.},
