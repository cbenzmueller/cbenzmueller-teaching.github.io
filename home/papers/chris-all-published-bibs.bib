                  applications often requires the help of mediator systems as middleware
                  components. In the domain of theorem proving large efforts have been
                  made to formalize knowledge for mathematics and verification issues, and
                  to structure it in databases. But these databases are either specialized
                  for a single client, or if the knowledge is stored in a general
                  database, the services this database can provide are usually limited and
                  hard to adjust for a particular theorem prover. Only recently there have
                  been initiatives to flexibly connect existing theorem proving systems
                  into networked environments that contain large knowledge bases. An
                  intermediate layer containing both, search and proving functionality can
                  be used to mediate between the two. In this paper we motivate the need
                  and discuss the requirements for mediators between mathematical
                  knowledge bases and theorem proving systems. We also present an attempt
                  at a concurrent mediator between a knowledge base and a proof planning
                  system.}

                  proving environment TPS [Andrews96] into the mathematical assistant
                  OMEGA [Omega97]. TPS can be called from OMEGA either as a black box or
                  as an interactive system. In black box mode, the user has control over
                  the parameters which control proof search in TPS; in interactive mode,
                  all features of the TPS-system are available to the user. If the
                  subproblem which is passed to TPS contains concepts defined in OMEGA's
                  database of mathematical theories, these definitions are not
                  instantiated but are also passed to TPS. Using a special theory which
                  contains proof tactics that model the ND-calculus variant of TPS within
                  OMEGA, any complete or partial proof generated in TPS can be translated
                  one to one into an OMEGA proof plan. Proof transformation is realised by
                  proof plan expansion in OMEGA's 3-dimensional proof data structure, and
                  remains transparent to the user.},

                  of state of the art distribution techniques to decentralise and spread
                  its reasoning agents over the internet. The approach particularly
                  supports cooperative proofs between reasoning agents which are strong in
                  different applications areas, e.g., higher-order and first-order theorem
                  provers and computer algebra systems.}

                  fifteen (interactive) theorem proving systems, which were asked to
                  present their solution. This represents an important shift of emphasis
                  in the field of automated deduction away from the somehow artificial
                  problems of the past as represented, for example, in the test set of the
                  TPTP library back to real mathematical challenges. In this paper we
                  present an overview of the OMEGA system as far as it is relevant for the
                  purpose of this paper and show the development of a proof for this

                  environments is, among other things, strongly influenced by the

                  commands. Such mechanisms support the user by decreasing the necessary
                  interactions during the proof construction. Although many systems offer
                  such facilities, they are often limited in their functionality. In this
                  paper we present a new agent-based mechanism that independently observes
                  the proof state, steadily computes suggestions on how to further
                  construct the proof, and communicates these suggestions to the user via
                  a graphical user interface. We furthermore introduce a focus technique
                  in order to restrict the search space when deriving default
                  suggestions. Although the agents we discuss in this paper are rather
                  simple from a computational viewpoint, we indicate how the presented
                  approach can be extended in order to increase its deductive power.}

                  adapting traditional first-order (FO) paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and
                  a calculus $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO
                  logic (based on Church's simply typed $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$
                  and $\EXTRUE$ extend the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin completeness
                  without the need for additional extensionality axioms both calculi
                  employ new, positive extensionality rules analogously to the respective
                  negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that operate on unification
                  constraints. As the extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
                  looses its pure term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise rather well with the
                  difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution idea.}

                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. The
                  technique can be applied (amongst other) to learn whether and when to
                  call external systems such as theorem provers or computer algebra

                  increase of proof-lengths in formal systems when carrying through the
                  argument at too low a level. More concretely, restricting the order of
                  the logic in which the proof is carried through to the order of the
                  logic in which the problem is formulated in the first place can result
                  in unmanageable long proofs, although there are short proofs in a logic
                  of higher order. Our motivation in this paper is of practical nature and
                  its aim is to sketch the implications of this example to current
                  technology in automated theorem proving, to point to related questions
                  about the foundational character of type theory (without explicit
                  comprehension axioms) for mathematics, and to work out some challenging
                  aspects with regard to the automation of this proof -- which, as we
                  belief, nicely illustrates the discrepancy between the creativity and
                  intuition required in mathematics and the limitations of state of the

                  differential equations, subsumption and consistency of sets of
                  constraints. A further candidate can be the elimination of second order

                  example we show how \tps\/ proofs can be inserted into OMEGA's
                  knowledge base by expanding them to calculus level using both OMEGA's

  abstract =	 {Today's interactive mathematics textbooks use a collection of predefined
                  documents, typically organized as a network of html pages. This makes a
                  reuse and a sound re-combination of the encoded knowledge impossible and
                  inhibits a radical adaption of course presentation and content to the
                  user's needs. In order to avoid these drawbacks we have designed a
                  web-based framework for dynamically producing interactive documents for
                  learning mathematics called ID. The system design relies on the
                  separation of knowledge representation from system
                  functionalities. Salient features of our system are the individual
                  generation of interactive documents based on general domain knowledge,
                  user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge as well as the
                  integration of external problem solving systems. The paper describes the
                  distributed web-based architecture of our system and the principles of
                  its components.}

                  an automated learning capability. The idea is that a proof planner would
                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of
                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. This is
                  work in progress, and we hope to gain useful feedback from the workshop

                  proving systems or proof planning systems for classical first-order
                  logic. Due to Huang the notion of assertion comprises mathematical
                  knowledge from a mathematical knowledge base KB such as definitions,
                  theorems, and axioms. %, as well as assumptions generated within the
                  prover during proof construction. We propose a distributed mediator
                  module between KB and a theorem proving system S which is independent of
                  the particular proof representation format of S and which applies
                  generalized resolution in order to analyze the logical consequences of
                  arbitrary assertions for a proof context at hand. Our approach is
                  applicable without any extension also to the assumptions that are
                  dynamically created during a proof search process. It therefore realizes
                  a crucial first step towards full automation of assertion level
                  reasoning. We discuss the benefits and connection of our approach to
                  proof planning and motivate an application in a project aiming at a

  abstract =	 {Research on automated and interactive theorem proving aims at the
                  mechanization of logical reasoning. Aside from the development of logic
                  calculi it became rapidly apparent that the organization of proof search
                  on top of the calculi is an essential task in the design of powerful
                  theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how to organize proof
                  search have emerged in that area of research, the most prominent
                  representatives are generally described by the buzzwords: automated
                  theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof planning. Despite
                  their paradigmatic differences, all approaches share a common goal: to
                  find a proof for a given conjecture. In this paper we start with a
                  rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms in the area of proof
                  planning and tactical theorem proving. Guided by similarities between
                  software engineering and proof construction we develop a uniform view
                  that accommodates the various proof search methodologies and eases their
                  comparison. Based on this view, we propose a unified framework that
                  enables the combination of different methodologies for proof
                  construction to take advantage of their individual virtues within
                  specific phases of a proof construction.},

  ABSTRACT =	 { Garg and Abadi recently proved that prominent
                  access control logics can be translated in a sound
                  and complete way into modal logic S4. We have
                  previously outlined how normal multimodal logics,
                  including monomodal logics K and S4, can be embedded
                  in simple type theory and we have demonstrated that
                  the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can automate
                  reasoning in and about them. In this paper we
                  combine these results and describe a sound embedding
                  of different access control logics in simple type
                  theory. Employing this framework we show that the
                  off the shelf theorem prover LEO-II can be applied
                  to automate reasoning in prominent access control
                  logics.  },

abstract={We give some lectures on the work on formal logic of Jacques Herbrand, and sketch his life and his influence on automated theorem proving. The intended audience ranges from students interested in logic over historians to logicians. Besides the well-known correction of Herbrand's False Lemma by Goedel and Dreben, we also present the hardly known unpublished correction of Heijenoort and its consequences on Herbrand's Modus Ponens Elimination. Besides Herbrand's Fundamental Theorem and its relation to the Loewenheim-Skolem-Theorem, we carefully investigate Herbrand's notion of intuitionism in connection with his notion of falsehood in an infinite domain. We sketch Herbrand's two proofs of the consistency of arithmetic and his notion of a recursive function, and last but not least, present the correct original text of his unification algorithm with a new translation.},

abstract={When mathematicians present proofs they usually adapt their explanations to their didactic goals and to the (assumed) knowledge of their addressees. Modern automated theorem provers, in contrast, present proofs usually at a fixed level of detail (also called granularity). Often these presentations are neither intended nor suitable for human use. A challenge therefore is to develop user- and goal-adaptive proof presentation techniques that obey common mathematical practice. We present a flexible and adaptive approach to proof presentation that exploits machine learning techniques to extract a model of the specific granularity of proof examples and employs this model for the automated generation of further proofs at an adapted level of granularity.},
