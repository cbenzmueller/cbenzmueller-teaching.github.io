  ABSTRACT =	 {This paper presents two approaches to primitive equality treatment in
                  higher-order (HO) automated theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$
                  adapting traditional first-order (FO) paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and
                  a calculus $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO
                  logic (based on Church's simply typed $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$
                  and $\EXTRUE$ extend the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin completeness
                  without the need for additional extensionality axioms both calculi
                  employ new, positive extensionality rules analogously to the respective
                  negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that operate on unification
                  constraints. As the extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
                  looses its pure term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise rather well with the
                  difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution idea.}
