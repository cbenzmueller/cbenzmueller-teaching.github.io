  abstract =	 {In this contribution we propose an agent architecture for theorem
                  proving which we intend to investigate in depth in the future. The work
                  reported in this paper is in an early state, and by no means
                  finished. We present and discuss our proposal in order to get feedback
                  from the Calculemus community.},
