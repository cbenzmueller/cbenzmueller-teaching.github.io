                  interactive reasoning. It combines ideas from two subfields of AI
                  (theorem proving/proof planning and multi-agent systems) and makes use
                  of state of the art distribution techniques to decentralise and spread
                  its reasoning agents over the internet. The approach particularly
                  supports cooperative proofs between reasoning agents which are strong in
                  different applications areas, e.g., higher-order and first-order theorem
                  provers and computer algebra systems.}

                  fifteen (interactive) theorem proving systems, which were asked to
                  present their solution. This represents an important shift of emphasis
                  in the field of automated deduction away from the somehow artificial
                  problems of the past as represented, for example, in the test set of the
                  TPTP library back to real mathematical challenges. In this paper we
                  present an overview of the OMEGA system as far as it is relevant for the
                  purpose of this paper and show the development of a proof for this

  abstract =	 {The acceptance and usability of current interactive theorem proving
                  environments is, among other things, strongly influenced by the
                  availability of an intelligent default suggestion mechanism for
                  commands. Such mechanisms support the user by decreasing the necessary
                  interactions during the proof construction. Although many systems offer
                  such facilities, they are often limited in their functionality. In this
                  paper we present a new agent-based mechanism that independently observes
                  the proof state, steadily computes suggestions on how to further
                  construct the proof, and communicates these suggestions to the user via
                  a graphical user interface. We furthermore introduce a focus technique
                  in order to restrict the search space when deriving default
                  suggestions. Although the agents we discuss in this paper are rather
                  simple from a computational viewpoint, we indicate how the presented
                  approach can be extended in order to increase its deductive power.}

  ABSTRACT =	 {This paper presents two approaches to primitive equality treatment in
                  higher-order (HO) automated theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$
                  adapting traditional first-order (FO) paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and
                  a calculus $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO
                  logic (based on Church's simply typed $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$
                  and $\EXTRUE$ extend the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach Henkin completeness
                  without the need for additional extensionality axioms both calculi
                  employ new, positive extensionality rules analogously to the respective
                  negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that operate on unification
                  constraints. As the extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO paramodulation approach
                  looses its pure term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise rather well with the
                  difference-reducing HO RUE-resolution idea.}

                  suggest appropriate commands together with possible command argument
                  instantiations. Experiments with this approach show that its

                  concept. In this paper we provide an abstract view on the overall

                  discuss its realization within the agent architecture.}

                  an automated learning capability. The idea is that a proof planner would
                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of
                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. The
                  technique can be applied (amongst other) to learn whether and when to
                  call external systems such as theorem provers or computer algebra
                  systems. This is work in progress, and we hope to gain useful feedback
