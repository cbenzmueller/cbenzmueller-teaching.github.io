  abstract =	 {In this paper we present an extensional higher-order resolution calculus
                  that is complete relative to Henkin model semantics. The treatment of
                  the extensionality principles -- necessary for the completeness result
                  -- by specialized (goal-directed) inference rules is of practical
                  applicability, as an implentation of the calculus in the LEO-System
                  shows. Furthermore, we prove the long-standing conjecture, that it is
                  sufficient to restrict the order of primitive substitutions to the order
                  of input formulae.}
