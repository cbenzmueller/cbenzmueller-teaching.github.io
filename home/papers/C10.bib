  abstract =	 {This paper discusses an agent based approach to automated and
                  interactive reasoning. It combines ideas from two subfields of AI
                  (theorem proving/proof planning and multi-agent systems) and makes use
                  of state of the art distribution techniques to decentralise and spread
                  its reasoning agents over the internet. The approach particularly
                  supports cooperative proofs between reasoning agents which are strong in
                  different applications areas, e.g., higher-order and first-order theorem
                  provers and computer algebra systems.}
