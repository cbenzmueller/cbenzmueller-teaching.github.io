  abstract =	 {We introduce a resource adaptive agent mechanism which supports the user
                  in interactive theorem proving. The mechanism, an extension
                  of~\cite{BeSo98b}, uses a two layered architecture of agent societies to
                  suggest appropriate commands together with possible command argument
                  instantiations. Experiments with this approach show that its
                  effectiveness can be further improved by introducing a resource
                  concept. In this paper we provide an abstract view on the overall
                  mechanism, motivate the necessity of an appropriate resource concept and
                  discuss its realization within the agent architecture.}
