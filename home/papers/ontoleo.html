<h2> Project ONTOLEO (Higher-Order Ontology-Reasoning with LEO-II) </h2>

In this DFG funded project
(DFG Forschungsstipendium) I collaborate with Articulate Software, Angwin,
CA, USA and apply the higher-order automated theorem prover LEO-II for
reasoning in ontologies. <p>

Further information on this project will be soon available. <p>
