  ABSTRACT =	 { Garg and Abadi recently proved that prominent
                  access control logics can be translated in a sound
                  and complete way into modal logic S4. We have
                  previously outlined how normal multimodal logics,
                  including monomodal logics K and S4, can be embedded
                  in simple type theory and we have demonstrated that
                  the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can automate
                  reasoning in and about them. In this paper we
                  combine these results and describe a sound embedding
                  of different access control logics in simple type
                  theory. Employing this framework we show that the
                  off the shelf theorem prover LEO-II can be applied
                  to automate reasoning in prominent access control
                  logics.  },
