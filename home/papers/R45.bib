abstract={We present a straightforward embedding of quantified multimodal logic in 
simple type theory and prove its soundness and completeness. Modal operators are replaced by quantification over a type of possible worlds. 
We present simple experiments, using existing higher-order theorem provers, to demonstrate that the embedding allows automated proofs of statements in these logics, as well as meta properties of them.},
