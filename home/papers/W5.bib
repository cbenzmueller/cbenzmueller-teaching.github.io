  abstract =	 {Today's interactive mathematics textbooks use a collection of predefined
                  documents, typically organized as a network of html pages. This makes a
                  reuse and a sound re-combination of the encoded knowledge impossible and
                  inhibits a radical adaption of course presentation and content to the
                  user's needs. In order to avoid these drawbacks we have designed a
                  web-based framework for dynamically producing interactive documents for
                  learning mathematics called ID. The system design relies on the
                  separation of knowledge representation from system
                  functionalities. Salient features of our system are the individual
                  generation of interactive documents based on general domain knowledge,
                  user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge as well as the
                  integration of external problem solving systems. The paper describes the
                  distributed web-based architecture of our system and the principles of
                  its components.}
