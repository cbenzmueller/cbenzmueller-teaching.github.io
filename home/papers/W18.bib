  abstract =	 {Verification of non-linear hybrid systems is a challenging task. Unlike
                  many other verification methods the deduction-based verification
                  approach we investigate in this paper avoids approximations and operates
                  directly on the original non-linear system specifications. This
                  approach, however, requires the solution of non-trivial mathematical
                  subtasks. We propose to model existing reasoning systems, such as
                  computer algebra systems and constraint solvers, as mathematical
                  services and to provide them in a network of mathematical tools in a way
                  that they can reasonably support subtasks as they may occur in formal
                  methods applications. The motivation is to make it simpler to implement
                  and test verification approaches by out-sourcing complex but precisely
                  identifiable mathematical subtasks for which specialised reasoners do
                  already exists.},
