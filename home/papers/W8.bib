  abstract =	 {In this paper we propose how proof planning systems can be extended by
                  an automated learning capability. The idea is that a proof planner would
                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of
                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. This is
                  work in progress, and we hope to gain useful feedback from the workshop
                  community.}
