                  respect to various combinations of Boolean extensionality and three
                  forms of functional extensionality. Furthermore, we develop a

                  model existence theorems) needed to analyze completeness of
                  (machine-oriented) higher order calculi with respect to these model

                  proving systems or proof planning systems for classical first-order
                  logic. Due to Huang the notion of assertion comprises mathematical
                  knowledge from a mathematical knowledge base KB such as definitions,
                  theorems, and axioms. %, as well as assumptions generated within the

                  module between KB and a theorem proving system S which is independent of
                  the particular proof representation format of S and which applies
                  generalized resolution in order to analyze the logical consequences of
                  arbitrary assertions for a proof context at hand. Our approach is
                  applicable without any extension also to the assumptions that are
                  dynamically created during a proof search process. It therefore realizes
                  a crucial first step towards full automation of assertion level
                  reasoning. We discuss the benefits and connection of our approach to
                  proof planning and motivate an application in a project aiming at a

  abstract =	 {Research on automated and interactive theorem proving aims at the
                  mechanization of logical reasoning. Aside from the development of logic
                  calculi it became rapidly apparent that the organization of proof search
                  on top of the calculi is an essential task in the design of powerful
                  theorem proving systems. Different paradigms of how to organize proof
                  search have emerged in that area of research, the most prominent
                  representatives are generally described by the buzzwords: automated
                  theorem proving, tactical theorem proving and proof planning. Despite
                  their paradigmatic differences, all approaches share a common goal: to
                  find a proof for a given conjecture. In this paper we start with a
                  rational reconstruction of proof search paradigms in the area of proof
                  planning and tactical theorem proving. Guided by similarities between
                  software engineering and proof construction we develop a uniform view
                  that accommodates the various proof search methodologies and eases their
                  comparison. Based on this view, we propose a unified framework that
                  enables the combination of different methodologies for proof
                  construction to take advantage of their individual virtues within
                  specific phases of a proof construction.},

                  and complete way into modal logic S4. We have
                  previously outlined how normal multimodal logics,
                  including monomodal logics K and S4, can be embedded
                  in simple type theory and we have demonstrated that
                  the higher-order theorem prover LEO-II can automate
                  reasoning in and about them. In this paper we
                  combine these results and describe a sound embedding
                  of different access control logics in simple type
                  theory. Employing this framework we show that the
                  off the shelf theorem prover LEO-II can be applied
                  to automate reasoning in prominent access control
                  logics.  },

abstract={We give some lectures on the work on formal logic of Jacques Herbrand, and sketch his life and his influence on automated theorem proving. The intended audience ranges from students interested in logic over historians to logicians. Besides the well-known correction of Herbrand's False Lemma by Goedel and Dreben, we also present the hardly known unpublished correction of Heijenoort and its consequences on Herbrand's Modus Ponens Elimination. Besides Herbrand's Fundamental Theorem and its relation to the Loewenheim-Skolem-Theorem, we carefully investigate Herbrand's notion of intuitionism in connection with his notion of falsehood in an infinite domain. We sketch Herbrand's two proofs of the consistency of arithmetic and his notion of a recursive function, and last but not least, present the correct original text of his unification algorithm with a new translation.},

abstract={When mathematicians present proofs they usually adapt their explanations to their didactic goals and to the (assumed) knowledge of their addressees. Modern automated theorem provers, in contrast, present proofs usually at a fixed level of detail (also called granularity). Often these presentations are neither intended nor suitable for human use. A challenge therefore is to develop user- and goal-adaptive proof presentation techniques that obey common mathematical practice. We present a flexible and adaptive approach to proof presentation that exploits machine learning techniques to extract a model of the specific granularity of proof examples and employs this model for the automated generation of further proofs at an adapted level of granularity.},

simple type theory and prove its soundness and completeness. Modal operators are replaced by quantification over a type of possible worlds. 
We present simple experiments, using existing higher-order theorem provers, to demonstrate that the embedding allows automated proofs of statements in these logics, as well as meta properties of them.},
