  ABSTRACT =	 {In this report we present a variety of model existence theorems for
                  classical higher-order logics. The extend the well-known abstract
                  consistency methods to higher-order logics and pinpoint the contribution
                  of extensionality. The results reported here weaken the saturation
                  precondition needed in earlier model existence theorems, making them
                  appliccable to cut-free higher-order logics. This report reprints the
                  article ``Higher Order Semantics and Extensionality'' under review by
                  the Journal of Symbolic Logic and develops the cut-free extensions in
                  detail.},
