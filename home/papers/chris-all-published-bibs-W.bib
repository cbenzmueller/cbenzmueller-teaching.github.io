                  handle the complexity of the information to be conveyed to the user and
                  to support his orientation in large-scale proofs. In this paper we
                  present a distributed client-server extension of the OMEGA proof
                  development system, focusing on the LOUI (Lovely OMEGA User Interface)
                  client. This graphical user interface provides advanced communication
                  facilities through an adaptable proof tree visualization and through
                  various selective proof object display methods. Some of LOUI's main
                  features are the graphical display of co-references in proof graphs, a
                  selective term browser, and support for dynamically adding knowledge to
                  partial proofs -- all based upon and implemented in a client-server
                  architecture.}

                  increase of proof-lengths in formal systems when carrying through the
                  argument at too low a level. More concretely, restricting the order of
                  the logic in which the proof is carried through to the order of the
                  logic in which the problem is formulated in the first place can result
                  in unmanageable long proofs, although there are short proofs in a logic
                  of higher order. Our motivation in this paper is of practical nature and
                  its aim is to sketch the implications of this example to current
                  technology in automated theorem proving, to point to related questions
                  about the foundational character of type theory (without explicit
                  comprehension axioms) for mathematics, and to work out some challenging
                  aspects with regard to the automation of this proof -- which, as we
                  belief, nicely illustrates the discrepancy between the creativity and
                  intuition required in mathematics and the limitations of state of the

                  candidates of mathematical service requests: the solution of
                  differential equations, subsumption and consistency of sets of
                  constraints. A further candidate can be the elimination of second order

                  example we show how \tps\/ proofs can be inserted into OMEGA's
                  knowledge base by expanding them to calculus level using both OMEGA's

  abstract =	 {Today's interactive mathematics textbooks use a collection of predefined
                  documents, typically organized as a network of html pages. This makes a
                  reuse and a sound re-combination of the encoded knowledge impossible and
                  inhibits a radical adaption of course presentation and content to the
                  user's needs. In order to avoid these drawbacks we have designed a
                  web-based framework for dynamically producing interactive documents for
                  learning mathematics called ID. The system design relies on the
                  separation of knowledge representation from system
                  functionalities. Salient features of our system are the individual
                  generation of interactive documents based on general domain knowledge,
                  user-specific preferences and the user's knowledge as well as the
                  integration of external problem solving systems. The paper describes the
                  distributed web-based architecture of our system and the principles of
                  its components.}

                  an automated learning capability. The idea is that a proof planner would
                  be capable of learning new proof methods from well chosen examples of
                  proofs which use a similar reasoning strategy to prove related theorems,
                  and this strategy could be characterised as a proof method. We propose a
                  representation framework for methods, and a machine learning technique
                  which can learn methods using this representation framework. This is
                  work in progress, and we hope to gain useful feedback from the workshop
                  community.}
