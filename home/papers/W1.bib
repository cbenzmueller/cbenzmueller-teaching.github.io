  abstract =	 {Most interactive proof development environments are insufficient to
                  handle the complexity of the information to be conveyed to the user and
                  to support his orientation in large-scale proofs. In this paper we
                  present a distributed client-server extension of the OMEGA proof
                  development system, focusing on the LOUI (Lovely OMEGA User Interface)
                  client. This graphical user interface provides advanced communication
                  facilities through an adaptable proof tree visualization and through
                  various selective proof object display methods. Some of LOUI's main
                  features are the graphical display of co-references in proof graphs, a
                  selective term browser, and support for dynamically adding knowledge to
                  partial proofs -- all based upon and implemented in a client-server
                  architecture.}
