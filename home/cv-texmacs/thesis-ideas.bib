  abstract    = {It is well-known that many relevant aspects of everyday reasoning
  based on natural language cannot be adequately expressed in
  classical first-order logic.  In this paper we address two of the
  problems, firstly that of so-called presuppositions,
  expressions from which it is possible to draw implicit conclusion,
  which classical logic normally does not warrant, and secondly the
  related problem of partiality and the adequate treatment of
  undefined expressions.  In natural language, presuppositions are
  quite common, they can, however, only insufficiently be modeled in
  classical first-order logic.  For instance, in the case of universal
  quantification one normally uses restrictions in natural language
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language.  Similarly,
  undefined expressions can be handled in natural language discourses
  and utterances are not only classified into the two categories
  `true' and `false'.  This has led to the development of various
  better-suited many-valued logics.
  
  By combining different approaches we can now give a static description of
  presuppositions and undefinedness within the same framework. Additionally, we
  have developed an efficient mechanization of the induced consequence relation (which
  has been missing in the literature) by combining methods from many-valued
  truth-functional logics and sort techniques developed for search control in
  automated theorem proving.}

 ABSTRACT = {Problems stemming from the study of logic calculi
in connection with an inference
rule called ``condensed detachment'' are widely acknowledged as
prominent test sets for automated deduction systems and their
search guiding heuristics. It is in the light of these problems that
we demonstrate the power of heuristics that make use of past proof
experience with numerous experiments.\\
We present two such heuristics. The first heuristic attempts to
re-enact a proof of a proof problem found in the past in a flexible
way in order to find a proof of a similar problem. The second
heuristic employs ``features'' in connection with past proof
experience to prune the search space.
Both these heuristics not only allow for substantial speed-ups,
but also make it possible to prove problems that were out of reach
when using so-called basic heuristics. Moreover, a combination
of these two heuristics can further increase performance.\\
We compare our results with the results the creators of OTTER
obtained with this renowned theorem prover and this way
substantiate our achievements.},

   ABSTRACT  = {The semantics of everyday language and the semantics of its naive
  translation into classical first-order language considerably
  differ. An important discrepancy that is addressed in this paper is
  about the implicit assumption what exists.  For instance, in the
  case of universal quantification natural language uses restrictions
  and presupposes that these restrictions are non-empty, while in
  classical logic it is only assumed that the whole universe is
  non-empty.  On the other hand, all constants mentioned in classical
  logic are presupposed to exist, while it makes no problems to speak
  about hypothetical objects in everyday language. These problems have
  been discussed in philosophical logic and some adequate many-valued
  logics were developed to model these phenomena much better than
  classical first-order logic can do. An adequate calculus, however,
  has not yet been given.  Recent years have seen a thorough
  investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional
  logics.  Unfortunately, restricted quantifications are not
  truth-functional, hence they do not fit the framework directly.  We
  solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.}}

They can be attached to variables. Semantically, the domain of a

Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified quantifier
tableaux rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableaux
is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableaux
with sorts and free variable tableaux with sorts are proved sound, complete and more
suitable for mechanization than their standard counterparts without sorts.},

ABSTRACT = {FLOTTER and SPASS are a clause normal form translator for first-order
logic and a theorem prover for first-order logic with equality, respectively.
The algorithm implemented by FLOTTER includes an improved form of the renaming technique
developed by Thierry Boy de la Tour and the optimized
Skolemization technique by Ohlbach and Weidenbach. 
SPASS is based on the superposition
calculus developed by Bachmair and Ganzinger
extended with the sort techniques developed by 
Weidenbach. The superposition
calculus relies on a reduction ordering which is total on ground terms. For
SPASS we chose an extension of the Knuth-Bendix ordering that was
first presented by Peterson.
In addition to the usual inference, deletion and simplification rules, 
SPASS includes a rule for case analysis, called splitting. },

   ABSTRACT  = {Even though it is not very often admitted, partial functions do play a
significant role in many practical applications of deduction
systems. Kleene has already given a semantic account of partial
functions using a three-valued logic decades ago, but there has not been
a satisfactory mechanization. Recent years have seen a thorough
investigation of the framework of many-valued truth-functional logics.
However, strong Kleene logic, where quantification is restricted and
therefore not truth-functional, does not fit the framework directly.
We solve this problem by applying recent methods from sorted logics.
This paper presents a tableau calculus that combines the proper
treatment of partial functions with the efficiency of sorted calculi.}}

ABSTRACT      = {The design and implementation of automated reasoning
systems has
advanced markedly in the last decade.  In particular, various term
indexing techniques have been developed. Term indexing supports the
construction of efficient automated reasoning systems by providing
rapid access to first-order predicate calculus terms with specific
properties. The author addresses the advanced designer of automated
reasoning systems and assumes that the reader has detailed knowledge
of automated reasoning and logic.

ABSTRACT = {Tableaux and the free variable tableaux are extended
with sorts. Sorts are sets of unary predicates.
They can be attached to variables. Semantically, the domain of a
variable is restricted to the intersection of the denotations of the attached predicates.
Syntactically, the sort information is exploited by modified $\gamma$ and $\delta$
rules. The standard unification algorithm of free variable tableaux
is replaced by a sorted unification algorithm. The resulting calculi, tableaux
with sorts and free variable tableaux with sorts are proved sound, complete and more
suitable for mechanization than their counterparts without sorts.},

 ABSTRACT = {We present a methodology for coupling several saturation-based 
theorem provers (running on different computers).
The methodology is well-suited for realizing cooperation between
different incarnations of one basic prover. Moreover, also
different heterogeneous provers --that differ from each other 
in the calculus and in the heuristic they employ--
can be coupled.
Cooperation between the different provers is achieved by
periodically interchanging clauses which are selected by 
so-called referees.
We present theoretic results regarding the completeness of the 
system of cooperating provers as well as describe concrete 
heuristics for designing referees. Furthermore, we report on 
two experimental studies performed with
homogeneous and heterogeneous provers in the areas superposition 
and unfailing completion. The results reveal that the occurring 
synergetic effects lead to a significant improvement of 
performance},

  discusses HOT's design that can be characterized as a concurrent Blackboard

	TITLE = {Human Oriented Proof Presentation:A Reconstructive Approach},
	PUBLISHER = {Infix},
	YEAR = {1996},
	ADDRESS = {Sankt Augustin},
abstract  = {Over the past thirty years there have been significant achievements in
the field of automated theorem proving with respect to the reasoning
power of the inference engines.  Although some effort has also been
spent to facilitate more user friendliness of the deduction systems,
most of them failed to benefit from more recent developments in the
related fields of artificial intelligence (AI), such as natural
language generation and user modeling. In particular, no model is
available which accounts both for human deductive activities {\em
  and\/} for human proof presentation.  In this thesis, a
reconstructive architecture is suggested which substantially
abstracts, reorganizes and finally translates machine-found proofs
into natural language. Both the procedures and the intermediate
representations of our architecture find their basis in computational
models for {\em informal mathematical reasoning\/} and for {\em proof
  presentation\/}.}

                Mathematica language and runs in the Mathematica
                environment. The goal of the project is to use a
                powerful symbolic computation system to prove theorems
                that are beyond the scope of previous automatic theorem
                provers. The theorem prover is also able to guarantee
                the correctness of certain steps that are made by the
                symbolic computation system and therefore prevent
                common errors like division by a symbolic expression
                that could be zero. In this paper we describe the
                structure of Analytica and explain the main techniques
                that it uses to construct proofs. We have tried to make
                the paper as self-contained as possible so that it will
                be accessible to a wide audience of potential users. We
                illustrate the power of our theorem prover by several
                non-trivial examples including the basic properties of
                the stereographic projection and a series of three
                lemmas that lead to a proof of Weierstrass's example of
                a continuous nowhere differentiable function. Each of
                the lemmas in the latter example is proved completely
                automatically.",

                they are non-trivial and require the use of symbolic

                  skolemization. It allows a lazy handling of instantiations as well as of the order of certain
                  reductions. We prove the soundness of a sequent calculus which incorporates a rule for simultaneous
                  quantifier elimination. The proof is performed by semantical arguments and provides some insights into
                  the dependencies between various formulas in a sequent.},

  abstract =	 {We introduce a resource adaptive agent mechanism which supports the user
                  in interactive theorem proving. The mechanism, an extension
                  of~\cite{BeSo98b}, uses a two layered architecture of agent societies to
                  suggest appropriate commands together with possible command argument
                  instantiations. Experiments with this approach show that its
                  effectiveness can be further improved by introducing a resource
                  concept. In this paper we provide an abstract view on the overall
                  mechanism, motivate the necessity of an appropriate resource concept and
                  discuss its realization within the agent architecture.}

                  agent-based command suggestion mechanism. The theorem prover inherits
                  beneficial properties from the underlying suggestion mechanism such as
                  run-time extendibility and resource adaptability. Moreover, it supports
                  the distributed integration of external reasoning systems. We also
                  discuss how the implementation and modeling of a calculus in our
                  agent-based approach can be investigated wrt. the inheritance of
                  properties such as completeness and soundness.}
