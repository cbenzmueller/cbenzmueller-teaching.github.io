          Christoph received his MSc, PhD and Habilitation in Computer Science
          from Saarland University, Germany and his PhD research on semantics
          and automation of higher-order logic, which he partly conducted at
          Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, USA, has been supported by
          a grant of the German 'Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes'. He is
          the main developer of the automated higher-order theorem prover LEO
          which he reimplemented and improved in the research project LEO-II
          with Prof. Lawrence Paulson in 2007 at Cambridge University, UK.
          Christoph Benzm&uuml;ller has also been working at the boundry of
          Computational Logic, Artificial Intelligence, Computational
          Linguistics and Computer-supported Mathematics in several projects
          at Saarland University, Germany, The University of Birmingham,
          England, and the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. He was head of
          the OMEGA group of Prof. J&ouml;rg Siekmann at Saarland University
          (2001-2007), he served as scientific coordinator of the European
          Union 5th Framework Research Training Network 'CALCULEMUS: Systems
          for integrated Computation and Deduction' (2000-2004), and he was
          principal investigator of four projects in the DFG Collaborative
          Research Center on Resource-adaptive Cognitive Processes (SFB 378)
          at Saarland University between 2001 and 2008. This includes the
          projects 'DIALOG: Natural language-based Interaction with a
          Mathematical Assistant System' and 'OMEGA: Agent-oriented Proof
          Planning'. The latest research activities of Christoph
          Benzm&uuml;ller include the automation of quantified multi-modal
          logics and access control logics (as natural fragments of
          higher-order logic) and the automation of challenge aspects (such as
          modalities and time) in ontology reasoning. In the latter research
          Christoph cooperated with Articulate Software, Angwin, CA, USA, in a
          DFG-Forschungsstipendium (2008-2011). In 2012 Christoph was awarded
          with a DFG Heisenberg fellowsh<strong></strong>ip. He is currently
          working at Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin.

          Christoph is an executive officer of The International Federation
          for Computational Logic (IFCOLOG), and a steering committee member
          of the User Interfaces for Theorem Provers (UITP) workshop series.
          He was formerly a trustee of the Conference on Automated Deduction
          (CADE), a trustee of CALCULEMUS and a steering committee member of
          the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR).
          Moreover, he is editorial board member of the Journal of Applied
          Logic, the Logic Journal of the IGPL, and the Journal of Algorithms
          in Cognition, Informatics and Logic. He served as chair of more than
          10 international workshops and he was main organizer and programme
          chair of the European Union CALCULEMUS summer school in Pisa in
          2002. He is co-author of more than 100 refereed publications in
          journals or at international conferences and workshops.
