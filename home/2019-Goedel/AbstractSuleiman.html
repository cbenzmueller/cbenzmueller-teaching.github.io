<body> <h1>The Life of Kurt G&ouml;del - Part II (1934-1978)</h1>
<h3>Nadja Suleiman (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

This talk gives an overview of Kurt G&ouml;del's life starting from his 
return to Europe in 1934 after having been lecturing at the IAS in 
Princeton to his final days in 1978. Firstly we'll focus on the second 
half of the most turbulent decade of his life: the mid to late 1930s 
with all the political atrocities in Germany, G&ouml;del's intercontinental 
travels to Princeton and Notre Dame, his marriage with Adele Porkert and 
some of the psychological troubles he went through. The talk will then 
shed light on G&ouml;del's emigration to the U.S., his work in Princeton, his 
general living circumstances and his friendship with the famous 
physicist Albert Einstein, him finally being accepted as a professor at 
the IAS and some of the awards he received. Lastly we'll take a quick 
look at the final two decades of G&ouml;del's life with his growing reclusion 
and his deteriorating mental and physical health.<br><br>

(This talk will be held in German)
