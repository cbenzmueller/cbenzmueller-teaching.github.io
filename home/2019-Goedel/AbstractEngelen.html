<body> <h1>Kurt G&ouml;del's &rsaquo;Maximen
  Philosophie&lsaquo;. An Overview</h1>
<h3>Eva-Maria Engelen (Universit&auml;t Konstanz)</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b> The talk offers a review of G&ouml;del's &rsaquo;Maximen
  Philosophie&lsaquo; within the realms of the state of research. The edition
of the 15 philosophical notebooks that have been found in G&ouml;del's
Nachlass is an on-going work already in progress, which will be
multiannual.  The statements made here can therefore be considered to
be only applicable for the time being, but a fascinating see behind
the curtain can already be opened up.  <br><br> <hr>
