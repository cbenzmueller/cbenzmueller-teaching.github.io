<body> <h1>G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorems in the Light of his Shorthand  Notebooks</h1>
<h3>Jan von Plato (University of Helsinki)</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b> G&ouml;del's shorthand notebooks show how his incompleteness theorem emerged in the summer and fall of 1930. A crucial turning point in the formulation and proof of the theorem took place right after the famous K&ouml;nigsberg meeting where G&ouml;del told about the result to von Neumann. The talk will document these developments through the original sources.
