<body> <h1>G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem</h1>
<h3>Valeria Zahoransky (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorem states that logical systems
capable of a certain expressivity cannot be consistent and
complete. This fact had far-reaching implications for mathematics and
metamathematics. We shall have a look at the structure of the proof
with an emphasis on the most important ideas like G&ouml;del's
numberings and diagonalisation.
