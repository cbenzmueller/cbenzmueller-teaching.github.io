<body> <h1>G&ouml;del's 14 Philosophical Viewpoints &ndash; Part 1</h1>
<h3>Jessica Lynn Concepcion (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

In his last years, G&ouml;del's interests became almost solely focused on
philosophy and in 1959 he began an intensive study of the work of both
Leibniz and Husserl. He hardly published any of his works, the same
applies for his 14 philosophical viewpoints, that he wrote in 1960.
In the following two parts of the presentation those 14 viewpoints are
described in detail for a better understanding of their meaning and
background.
