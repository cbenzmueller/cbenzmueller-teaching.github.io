In this presentation, the first part of KurtG&ouml;del life is discussed. We start with the childhood in Brno, moving to the teenager years in the Gymnasium, the time as a student in the University of Vienna when he obtained his greatest mathematical achievements, the influence of the Vienna Circle, the time when he wrote his dissertation, the pursuit of an academic career, the publication of the incompleteness theorems when he experienced both strong rejection and great recognition and lastly the invitation to lecture at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton.
