Interdisciplinary International Workshop at FU Berlin: 

                              Kurt Gödel: Philosophical Views

On Januar 14, 1978, Kurt Gödel, one of the greatest logicians of all times passed away. Today, nearly half a century later, we have still not exhaustively explored, discussed and conclusively assessed all of Gödel's visionary ideas. With our informal, one-day workshop we provide a forum for interested scientists from various disciplines to meet and discuss unexplored aspects in Gödel's work. A particular focus will be on his philosophical views. 


The workshop features invited presentations by:
- Prof. Dr. Eva-Maria Engelen (Konstanz)
- Prof. Dr. Srećko Kovač (Zagreb)
- Dr. Emil Weydert (Luxembourg)
- Prof. Dr. Jan von Plato (Helsinki) 
- Dr. Oliver Passon (Wuppertal)

The workshop, which is organised by Prof. Dr. Christoph Benzmüller, is open to the public. Interested students and researchers from other universities are particularly welcome.
