<body> <h1>Intuitionistic Logic versus Classical Logic - G&ouml;del's Interpretation and Conjectures.</h1>
<h3>Irina Makarenko (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

In the article "Eine Interpretation des intuitionistischen
Aussagenkalk&uuml;ls", presented in 1932 at the Mathematical
Colloquium in Vienna and published in 1933, G&ouml;del described an
interpretation of the intuitionistic propositional logic in a system
of classical propositional logic enriched with an additional unary
operator B (which stands for provability). The main purpose of this
talk is to give an overview on the given interpretation and the
involved logical systems, and also to discuss the connection between
the enriched system and
the modal logic S4.
