<body> <h1>Kurt G&ouml;del and the Foundations of Set Theory</h1>
<h3>Emil Weydert (University of Luxembourg)</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b> Kurt G&ouml;del has made important contributions to set
theory, as well by his seminal technical results, as by his inspiring
philosophical and methodological considerations. In particular he has
been the father of a lively research program whose goal is to identify
new, rationally justifiable axioms for set theory, thereby
transcending ZFC. It nourishes the hope to answer long-standing
questions in set theory and general mathematics, notably those known
to be independent from ZFC, like Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis.
