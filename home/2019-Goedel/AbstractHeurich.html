<body> <h1>G&ouml;del's
  Rationalism and Realism</h1>
<h3>Manuel Heurich (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

In this first part of the presentation we will take a closer look at
the tasks that he attributes to philosophy and how his thoughts can be
clustered into the two points of focus realism and
rationalism. G&ouml;del's basic philosophical views can be narrowed
down to these two streams. Therefore, we will try to structure and
examine his main beliefs to get a basic idea of his mindset.
