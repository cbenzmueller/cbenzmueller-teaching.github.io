<body> <h1>Implications of G&ouml;del's Incompleteness Theorems</h1>
<h3>Hannah Troppens (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

Even though the impact of Kurt G&ouml;del's work is mostly felt in
mathematics, his contributions are also considered in other areas. In
this talk the focus lies on the consequences of G&ouml;del's most famous
work: the Incompleteness Theorems.  This talk primarily explores the
historical context with emphasis on the philosophy of mathematics. In
the second part of the talk, the effect of the Incompleteness Theorems
on the debate on human mind is presented to show some implications
outside of mathematics.
