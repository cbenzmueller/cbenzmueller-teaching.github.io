<body> <h1>G&ouml;del's Ontological Argument  &ndash;  Contextualisation and Reception </h1>
<h3>Alexander Zachrau (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

A brief summary of the famous ontological argument, that was found in G&ouml;del's Nachlass, is
presented and the implications it bears. This includes a historical contextualisation of the
argument. Some variants of the arguments' premises are shown along with other scholarly
reactions to it. Finally, the significance of the work and the question in which way
metaphysics and computer science could be fruitful to one another is elaborated.
