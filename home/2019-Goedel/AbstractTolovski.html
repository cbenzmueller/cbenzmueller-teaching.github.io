<h3>Filip Tolovski (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

Special Relativity theory  and General Relativity theory from Albert
Einstein have since their publication in 1905 and 1915, accordingly,
provided answers to the everlasting questions of humanity about the nature
of time and the gravitation. In this presentation, adding to classical
mechanics, an  outline of the Special and General Relativity theory will
be given, finishing with a mention of  the possibility for time travel
according to the General Relativitiy Theory.
