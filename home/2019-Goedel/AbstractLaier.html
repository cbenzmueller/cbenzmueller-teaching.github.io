<body> <h1>Evolution of
  G&ouml;del's Philosophical Viewpoints</h1>
<h3>Cedric Laier (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

It is now well known that G&ouml;del first represented the philosophy of
Leibniz and then, since 1959, that of Husserl. This raises three
questions: <br>

&emsp; (1) How is this turn to Husserl to be interpreted? Is it a dismissal from
Leibnizian philosophy or another way to achieve similar goals? <br>

&emsp; (2) Why did G&ouml;del specifically turn to the later transcendental idealism of
the Husserl? <br>

&emsp; (3) Is there a discernible influence of Husserl on G&ouml;del's
writings? <br>

Based on the work "On the Philosophical Development of Kurt G&ouml;del" by Mark
van Atten and Juliette Kennedy, in this part of the presentation we try to
clarify these questions and gain further insights into his philosophical
development over the years.
