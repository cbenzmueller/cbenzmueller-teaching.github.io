<body> <h1>Further Works based on G&ouml;del's "Eine Interpretation des Intuitionistischen
Aussagenkalk&uuml;ls"</h1>
<h3>Leon Dirmeier (Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin)</h3>

The talk will be focused on the consequences of the described translation
in "Eine Interpretation des intuitionistischen Aussagenkalküls" (1933).
In this paper G&ouml;del conjectured, that the converse of his translations
would also hold. We will take a look at "Some Theorems About the Sentential Calculi of
Lewis and Heyting" by McKinsey and Tarski (1948), who used algebraic terms
to proove Gödel's conjecture. Finally, we'll give an outlook on different notions of translations by
various authors.
